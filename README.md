What is Axiloop?
================

**Axiloop** is a package for Wolfram Mathematica. It can calculate analytical
expressions for DGLAP evolution kernels (also known as splitting functions; that
is probabilities for a parton (quark or gluon) to emit another parton) to the
next-to-leading order in massless QCD.
